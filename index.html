              <h1>Mental Health</h1>
              <p class="info">Mental health is a state of well being and individual and collective ability as humans to think, interact and cope with stress and work productively to make contribution to our community. 
              Poor mental health can adversely impact social determinants including economic security, safety, employment, lifestyle, as well as contributing to risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.

                Depression is a common illness worldwide (3.8% of the population, about 280 people).
                Mental disorders contribute to significantly high mortality rate than the general population with a median life expectancy loss of 10.1 years. (JAMA Psychiatry, 2015)
                It is estimated mental disorders are cause 14.3% of deaths worldwide, or approximately 8 million deaths each year. (JAMA Psychiatry, 2015).

                Although there are known, effective treatments available, more than 75% of people in low- and middle-income countries cannot access to them*. Lack of facilities and skilled health-care practitioners, and the social stigma are all obstacles to effective treatment. 
                This project aims to shed light on prevalence, risk and impact of several mental health issues that are impacting people worldwide as well as highlighting the disparity among different countries to access to the resources.
